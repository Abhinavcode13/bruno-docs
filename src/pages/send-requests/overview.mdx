# Sending Requests and Handling Responses in Bruno

Developing your own API or testing any third party API you can use Bruno as a **API Testing Client** to send request and receive response. You can send, add, update and delete the data with paramaters and autorization details.

In the above interface we are sending `post` request to Bruno echo server with json body with `msg` and `name` keys. The echo server will respond with same data we sent in a request and as a output we are getting same output int the response section.
