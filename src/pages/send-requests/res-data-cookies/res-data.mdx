# Response Data

The API returns data as a response from the server after the request is executed. The response panel in Bruno provides you with an organized view of the API's response, including the body, headers, HTTP status code, raw response code, and more.

### Response Panel

After executing a request, the response panel provides detailed information on the API's response. It shows the response body, headers, status code, and other relevant data. You can also search within the response using the `cmd+f` or `ctrl+f` keyboard shortcut.
