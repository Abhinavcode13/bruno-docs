Bruno enables you to send Graphql request. Create new request inside collection and select `GraphQL` as request type and provide url with name in the input box.

The default method for working with GraphQL APIs is POST, but you can adjust it based on your preferences.

### GraphQL request with query

Bruno provides a dedicated section called **Query** where you can write and execute all your GraphQL queries. This section is designed to make it easy for you to interact with the GraphQL API by allowing you to define the data you want to retrieve or manipulate.
