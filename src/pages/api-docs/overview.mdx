# APIs Documentation

Bruno allows you to create API documentation at three distinct levels: **Request, Folder, and Collection**. With full Markdown support, you can write clear, concise, and well-structured documentation at each level.

1. [Document a request](./request-docs.mdx)
2. [Document a folder](./folder-docs.mdx)
3. [Document a collection](./collection-docs.mdx)
