# Secrets Management

## DotEnv File

This approach is inspired by how usually developers manage secrets in their source code.

In this approach, you can store all your secrets in a `.env` file at the **root** of your collection folder.

The folder structure should be arranged as follows:

<FileTree.Folder name="bruno-collection" defaultOpen>
  <FileTree.Folder name="api-folder" >
    <FileTree.Folder name="customer-api" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="emp-api">
      <FileTree.File name="details.bru" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.File name="lib.js" />
  
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name=".gitignore" />
  <FileTree.File name="bruno.json" />
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
   <FileTree.File name=".env" />
</FileTree.Folder>


Bruno will automatically load the secrets from this file and make them available to your collection via `process.env.<secret-name>`.

Your environment file at `environments/local.bru` would look like
```bash filename="local.bru"
vars {
  host: http://localhost:5005
  jwtToken: {{process.env.JWT_TOKEN}}
}
```

And now you can safely check in your collection to source control without worrying about exposing your secrets.
Don't forget to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file.

You can store a `.env.sample` file in your collection folder to help other developers get started with the collection.
