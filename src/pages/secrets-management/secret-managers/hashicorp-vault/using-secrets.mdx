Secrets are accessed in the same way as collection and environment variables. The secrets can be accessed in headers, query, body, auth input fields similar to collection and environment variables.

Secrets need to be prefixed with `$secrets` followed by the `secret name` and then the `key name`, all separated by periods.

Pattern: `$secrets`.`<secret-name>`.`<key-name>`.
