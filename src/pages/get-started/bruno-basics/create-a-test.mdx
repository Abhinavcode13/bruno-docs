# Create a Test

To ensure your API is behaving as expected, create a test against it.

Bruno supports writing tests by through either:

- Assertions to declaratively write tests
- JavaScript

## Assertion

To get familiar with testing, open a Collection, select a request, and click on the `Assertions` tab

You can then dictate an expression, operator, and value to test against.

## Testing with JavaScript

Bruno also supports writing automation test scripts in JavaScript for more advanced API testing scenarios. By automating your tests, you can increase efficiency and coverage, streamline regression testing, and integrate testing into CI/CD pipelines.

#### Example

```js copy
test("should be able to login", function () {
  const data = res.getBody();
  expect(res.getStatus()).to.equal(200);
});

test("should receive the token", function () {
  const data = res.getBody();
  expect(data.token).to.be.a("string");
});
```

![bru lang sample](/screenshots/testing.webp)

In this example:

1. The first test checks that the response status is 200 (indicating a successful login).
2. The second test verifies that the response contains a token, and the token is of type `string`.
