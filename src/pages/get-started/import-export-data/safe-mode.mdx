# Safe Mode

Bruno takes security seriously and wants you to safely interact with collections no matter the source or original authors.
Safe mode lets you choose whether imported Collections should be able to execute the JavaScript that can exist inside of Variables, Scripts, Tests, and Assertions.

You will see the following dialog when interacting with an imported Collection:

> **Note**: When in doubt, leave the Collection in Safe Mode. You can always switch to Develeoper Mode later.
