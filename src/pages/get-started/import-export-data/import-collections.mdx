# Importing Collections 

It's very common that users transition to Bruno from another tool, or chose to use Bruno while their colleauges may chose something else. 

Whatever the case, you can import the following formats as Bruno Collections:

- Bruno Collection (if a Collection is manually shared with you)
- Postman Collection
- Postman Data Export
- Insomnia Collection
- Cloning a Git Repository
- OpenAPI V3 file 
- OpenAPI V3 URL 

> `Cloning a Git Repository` is available in our Golden and Ultimate Editions. Please see [Collaboration in Bruno](https://docs.usebruno.com/git-integration/overview) for more details.
> `Postman Data Export` is available in our Ultimate Edition. Please see [Migrating from Postman](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/import-export-data/postman-migration) for more details.

### Importing Process

Either click `Import Collection` on the home screen of Bruno or select the elipses in the top-left corner then navigate to `Import Collection`.
