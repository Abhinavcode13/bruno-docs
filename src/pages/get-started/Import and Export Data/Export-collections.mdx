#Exporting Collections

If your whole team isn't using Bruno (yet), no fear! You can export Bruno collections to other formats. 

Our preffered recommendation for sharing collections is using native Git versioning, but we realize there are other scenarios where exporting makes sense. 

Bruno allows you to export as:
- Bruno Collection
- Postman Collection
- OpenAPI Specification

> *Exporting as an OpenAPI Specification is only available in our Golden and Ultimate Editions*

To export, simply hover on the Collection you'd like to export, click the `...` menu, select the format, and finally the location you'd like to export to.
