# Authenticate with NTLM 

NTLM (NT LAN Manager) is a Microsoft authentication protocol used for Windows-based systems. Its challenge-response authentication mechanism is primarily used for:
- SharePoint
- Exchange
- Internal corporate APIs

Unlike basic authentication, which has a less secure protection layer, NTLM has multiple handshake steps and offers more robust security.
