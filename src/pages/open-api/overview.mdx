# OpenAPI and Bruno

OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a standard format for reading and describing HTTP APIs. This allows people to understand how an API works, how a sequence of APIs work together, generate client code, create tests, apply design standards, and more. 

Bruno allows you to work with OpenAPI Specification (OAS) files in a number of ways:

- [Creating a collection from an OAS file import](./importOAS.mdx)
- [Exporting a collection as an OAS file](./exportOAS.mdx) <PremiumBadge />
- [Viewing and Designing an OAS file](./createOAS.mdx) <PremiumBadge />
