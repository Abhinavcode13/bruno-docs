# Create AOS 

## Viewing and Designing an OAS file <PremiumBadge />

If you've saved or otherwise have an OAS file on your machine, you can view the OAS in a SwaggerUI-esque manner by:

- Selecting Open API Spec

![open-open-api](/screenshots/open-api/open-api-spec.webp)

- Choose the file name and location that you want to open

This will then open the spec in a separate section of your Bruno sidebar called APIs.

If you want to create an OAS file, you can:

- Select Create API Spec
![create-open-api](/screenshots/open-api/create-api-spec.webp)

- Designate whether you want to create a Blank Spec, or generate it from an existing Bruno Collection

![location-open-api](/screenshots/open-api/select-api-spec-location.webp)

- Choose a name and location for the spec to be saved under.

You will now have the scaffolding of an OAS that you can continue to design.
