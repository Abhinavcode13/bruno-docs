# Overview

Bruno offers multiple ways to run your API tests. Testing is crucial for APIs, as a single failure can bring down the entire application. With Bruno, you can automate API tests using the [Collection Runner](https://docs.usebruno.com/get-started/bruno-basics/run-a-collection) or the [bru CLI](https://docs.usebruno.com/bru-cli/overview) to integrate testing into your CI/CD pipeline.

### Automated Testing in CI/CD

Bruno offers a command-line utility to run Collections. This allows you to integrate your tests into a CI and build process.
