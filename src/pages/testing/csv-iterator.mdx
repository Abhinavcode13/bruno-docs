# Iterate with CSV 

The Runner feature enables you to iterate over files, making it easy to manage and manipulate data inputs. Bruno support both **CSV** and **JSON** files for running requests.

# Introduction 

In this tutorial, we'll explore the bruno-runner feature, which allows users to iterate over multiple files. Weâ€™ll be using the [reqres](https://reqreq.in) API to make requests, but you can use any API you prefer.

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Open the Bruno app.**
2. **Create a collection** called runner-example.
3. **Create a POST request** and name it runner-request.
4. **Use the URL**: https://reqres.in/api/users.

> **Optional**: You can choose the JSON option in the body and provide any JSON data that suits your API.

You need csv file with some dumy data.

## Using bruno-runner

Now you're ready to use bruno-runner. You can access it in two ways:

- **From the Bruno GUI app**
- **Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)**

 


## CSV Runner in the Bruno App

1. Click on the runner icon in the right-hand navbar.
2. Check the **Run with Parameters** option.
3. Select the file type: CSV or JSON.
4. Click **Run Collection**.

Once the execution is complete, you can review the results for each individual request and check their statuses.

It will create a `results.html` file in your Bruno collection's root directory. You can view this file in your browser.

### Command Overview 
1. ` --output results.html` : Specifies the output file for the results of your API tests.
2. ` --format [string]` : Defines the format of the output file.
3. ` --csv-file-path /path/to/csv/file.csv` : Indicates the path to the CSV file you want to use.
