# Creating a JS File in Bruno <PremiumBadge />

Bruno provides the ability to create JavaScript tests where you can modularize common code and reuse the tests across different requests or collections.

This can be especially helpful in complex scripting scenarios where the same test will be run across multiple requests, or you're looking to leverage data that lays outside of Bruno.

## Create a New Script

You can generate a JS File by:

1. Right click on any collection and folder
2. Select `New Script` from dropdown.

3. Enter name and click on **Create** button

## Import the Function(s)

Once your JS File has been you can now import the functions into any `Script` tab across your resources.

When the requests are run, you will see the script being invoked.
