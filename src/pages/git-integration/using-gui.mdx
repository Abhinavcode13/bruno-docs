# **Collaboration via GUI** <PremiumBadge />

Bruno offers an intuitive **GUI-based Git collaboration** feature, available in the **Pro** and **Ultimate Editions**. This feature makes it easier for both engineering and non-engineering teams to collaborate seamlessly on collections.

> Git must be installed on your machine to use this feature!


The following actions are possible through the GUI:

- [Initializing Git in a Collection](#initializing-git)
- [Adding and Committing Changes](#adding-and-committing-changes)
- [Pushing and Pulling Changes](#pushing-and-pulling-changes)
- [Branch Creation and Checkout](#branch-creation-and-checkout)
- [Cloning a Repository](#cloning-collections-from-github)


## **Initializing Git**

Initializing Git in Bruno is the first step towards managing your API collections with version control. It’s easy and quick to set up. Follow the steps below to initialize Git:

1. Launch the **Bruno app**.
2. Navigate to the collection you want to initialize with Git.
3. Click on the **Git icon** to open the **Git modal dialog**.
4. Click the **Initialize** button to set up your collection with Git.

 This allows you to perform other Git operations such as adding, committing, pushing, pulling changes, and more.

## **Adding and Committing Changes**

Once you’ve made changes to your collection in Bruno, you can easily commit those changes using the Git UI. This allows you to track changes and collaborate with your team efficiently.

> If you are unfamiliar working with Git, an initial commit is required for a repository. So although you may not have any changes to the collection you're trying to store on Git, you will start by committing changes to the repository itself. 

Follow these steps to add and commit changes:

1. Navigate to Your Collection and Access **Git UI**.
2. Go to the **Changes Tab**. 
3. Click on **add icon** for the changes you want to commit.
4. Click on **Commit Changes** button. 
5. Write a Commit Message and click **Commit**. 

> You can commit all changes in a single click by pressing the **Add All Changes** button.

By following these steps, your changes are now committed and tracked in Git, ready to be pushed or shared with others.

Once the branch is created, you can start making changes to the branch.
You can **push** changes from your local environment to the remote repository or **pull** changes from the remote to your local branch.


## **Pushing and Pulling Changes**

The GUI-based Git integration in Bruno allows both engineering and non-engineering teams to work together in a fast, efficient, and accurate manner. This integration ensures that your collections remain consistently up-to-date across all team members.

>  Before you can push or pull changes, ensure that the **remote repository** is linked to your project. 


### **Pushing Changes**
