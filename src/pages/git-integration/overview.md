# Version controlling in Bruno

The main feature of Bruno is its ability to collaborate using version controlling systems like [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), [CVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System), etc, and platforms like GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc. The process of collaborating on a Bruno collection is more or less the same in all of the above-mentioned platforms. For beginners, you can take a look at this tutorial on version controlling [^1].

There are two ways to use the version controlling feature in Bruno, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. One way is to use the terminal or command line to execute Git commands, and the other way is to use the built-in Git functionalities in Bruno without leaving the app. It's important to note that the latter is only available in the Golden edition of Bruno, making it easier for users to manage their version control directly within the app.

The two ways are documented separately for ease of access. So let's dive into the next section.
