## **Connecting to Remote Repository**

Once you have initialized your collection, the next step is to connect it to a remote Git repository. 

1. **Create a Remote Repository on GitHub:**
   - Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository.
   - Note the repository URL, which will be used to link your local collection.

2. **Connect Your Local Collection to the Remote Repository:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where your collection is stored.
   - Run the following commands to add, commit your changes, and link the local collection to the remote repository.

   Add all the collection changes. 

   ```bash copy
   git add .
   ```

   Commit all the changes you have added.
   ```bash copy
   git commit -m "commit-message"
   ```

   Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repo-name` with the name of the repository you created

   ```bash copy
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   ```

   Push local changes to remote repository.
   ```bash copy
   git push -u origin main
   ```



After completing the above steps, your collection will be pushed to GitHub and should be visible in your repository.
Once your collection is connected to the remote repository, you can manage it directly from the Bruno app.

Once you’ve made changes to your collection in Bruno, you can easily commit those changes using the Git UI. This allows you to track changes and collaborate with your team efficiently.
