# **Collaboration via GUI** <PremiumBadge />

Bruno offers an intuitive **GUI-based Git collaboration** feature, available in the **Pro** and **Ultimate Editions**. This feature makes it easier for both engineering and non-engineering teams to collaborate seamlessly on collections.

> You need to have Git installed on your machine to use these feature.


This feature includes following actions:

- [Initializing Git in a Collection](#initializing-git)
- [Adding and Committing Changes](#adding-and-committing-changes)
- [Pushing and Pulling Changes](#pushing-and-pulling-changes)
- [Branch Creation and Checkout](#branch-creation-and-checkout)
- [Cloning a Repository](#cloning-collections-from-github)


## **Initializing Git**

Initializing Git in Bruno is the first step towards managing your API collections with version control. It’s easy and quick to set up. Follow the steps below to initialize Git:

1. Launch the **Bruno app**.
2. Navigate to the collection you want to initialize with Git.
3. Click on the **Git icon** to open the **Git modal dialog**.
4. Click the **Initialize** button to set up your collection with Git.

 This allows you to perform other Git operations such as adding, committing, pushing, pulling changes, and more.

## **Connecting to Remote Repository**

Once you have initialized your collection, the next step is to connect it to a remote Git repository. 

1. **Create a Remote Repository on GitHub:**
   - Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository.
   - Note the repository URL, which will be used to link your local collection.

2. **Connect Your Local Collection to the Remote Repository:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the folder where your collection is stored.
   - Run the following commands to initialize Git, commit your changes, and link the local collection to the remote repository.

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
   git push -u origin main

3. Replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repo-name` with the name of the repository you created.

After completing the above steps, your collection will be pushed to GitHub and should be visible in your repository.
Once your collection is connected to the remote repository, you can manage it directly from the Bruno app.

## **Adding and Committing Changes**

Once you’ve made changes to your collection in Bruno, you can easily commit those changes using the Git UI. This allows you to track changes and collaborate with your team efficiently.

Follow these steps to add and commit changes:

1. Navigate to Your Collection and Access **Git UI**.
2. Go to the **Changes Tab**. 
3. Click on **add icon** for the changes you want to commit.
4. Click on **Commit Changes** button. 
5. Write a Commit Message and click **Commit**. 

> You can commit all changes in a single click by pressing the **Add All Changes** button.

By following these steps, your changes are now committed and tracked in Git, ready to be pushed or shared with others.

> You need to commit some changes to the **main** branch before you can create a new branch.


1. Open to the **Collection**.

2. Click on the **Main** and Create a **New Branch**.

3. Enter **Branch Name**.

5. Click on **Save** button.

Once the branch is created, you can start making changes to the branch.
You can **push** changes from your local environment to the remote repository or **pull** changes from the remote to your local branch.


## **Pushing and Pulling Changes**

The GUI-based Git integration in Bruno allows both engineering and non-engineering teams to work together in a fast, efficient, and accurate manner. This integration ensures that your collections remain consistently up-to-date across all team members.

>  Before you can push or pull changes, ensure that the **remote repository** is linked to your project. 


### **Pushing Changes**
Push your local changes to the remote repository with just a few clicks.

1. Click on **main** and Select **Push**.
2. Confirm the **Remote Server** configurations.
3. Click on **Push** button.

Now you can see all your local changes pushed to the remote repository.
