To install the Bruno CLI, use the node package manager of your choice, such as NPM:
```bash copy
npm install -g @usebruno/cli
```

## Getting Started

Navigate to the directory where your API collection resides, and run the following command:

```bash copy
bru run
```

This will run all the requests in your collection. If you want to run a single request, specify its filename:

```bash copy
bru run request.bru
```

## Running Requests in a Folder
To run all the requests within a folder, use:

```bash copy
bru run folder
```

## Using Environments
If you need to use a specific environment, you can pass it with the --env option:

```bash copy
bru run folder --env Local
```

## Passing Environment Variables

> Variables marked as secrets in Bruno app are not accessible via the CLI. Pass them directly as command-line arguments.

```bash copy
bru run folder --env Local --env-var JWT_TOKEN=1234
```
